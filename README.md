# ATM-Dashboard-PowerBI-Project

# Project Brief

This project looks at ATM transaction data to understand customer behavior and spot unusual activity. I cleaned and prepared the data in Power BI, then built a dashboard showing total withdrawals, transaction counts, and top locations with high ATM usage. It also highlights suspicious activity, making it easier to identify unusual spikes and monitor ATM performance.

# Dataset Description

ATM ID, location (city/state/country),
Withdrawal amount and count,
Unique card and customer information,
Date/time of transactions,
Suspicious activity flag.

# Business Problem:

Banks and ATM operators need to monitor ATM usage to understand customer demand, track withdrawal patterns, and detect suspicious activity. Without proper monitoring, fraud, cash shortages, or operational issues can go unnoticed.

# Solution Provided:

I cleaned the raw dataset, prepared the data in Power Query, and created an interactive Power BI dashboard. It includes KPIs, state/city breakdowns, suspicious activity visuals, and ATM distribution to help identify high-activity areas and unusual behavior.
