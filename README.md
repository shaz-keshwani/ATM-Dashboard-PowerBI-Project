# ATM-Dashboard-PowerBI-Project

# Project Brief

This project analyzes ATM transaction data to understand customer withdrawal patterns and identify unusual or suspicious activity.
I cleaned the raw dataset, prepared the data using Power Query, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard showing key metrics like
total withdrawal amounts, number of ATM transactions, unique card usage, and recurring customer behavior.

The dashboard highlights top states and cities with the highest ATM activity, compares ATM counts across countries, 
and visualizes suspicious-activity flags to help identify regions with unusual spikes. 
This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used for data cleaning, analysis, and real-time decision-making for ATM performance monitoring.
